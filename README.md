# How to play
There are two modes, you can play either a pre-made level or a randomly generated one.

Currently there are very few pre-made levels, so I would recommend the random mode.

# Notes
The algorithm for level difficulty is very simplistic so, level size is a much better indicator of difficulty

The puzzles generated in random mode are not unique, if you want unique puzzles see [this](https://github.com/jaredforrest/nonocross/issues/1) issue

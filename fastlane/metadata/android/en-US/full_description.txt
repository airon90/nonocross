What's Nonocross

Nonocross is a simple number puzzle game based around grids. The game is known by many names Nonograms, Picross, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix and various others.

- Modes
There are two game modes. You can either practice on a pre-made grid, or you can play a randomly generated grid with custom parameters.

- How to play
The game is relatively simple, the number in each row/column corresponds to the number of filled cells in that row/column. So '3 5' at the beginning of a column means there is a block of 3 cell and a block of 5 cell in that column which are not touching. Once you have the grid in front of you it will all make sense
